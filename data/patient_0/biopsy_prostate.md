DIAGNOSIS:

Intermediate needle biopsies from the prostate in 12 fractions with a total biopsy length of 128 mm. Adenocarcinoma demonstrated in 7
fractions with a total tumor length of 12.7 mm. Gleason score 3 + 4 = 7, ISUP 2. Gleason 4 component in 26: 590. Only fibromuscular tissue
in 5 of 12 biopsies.
