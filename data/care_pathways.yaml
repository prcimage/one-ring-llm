    ## Indications for Investigation – Symptoms

    The following symptoms in men over 40 years of age raise suspicion of prostate cancer and should lead to a PSA test in addition to prostate palpation:

    - Rapidly increasing (over the last six months), significant urinary problems
    - Increasing skeletal pain
    - Skeletal metastases without a known primary tumor
    - General cancer symptoms such as fatigue and loss of appetite. A PSA test should not be taken in connection with symptoms that could be due to an infection in
      the urinary tract or genitalia, unless the clinical suspicion of prostate cancer is very high. Macroscopic hematuria can be a symptom at the onset of
      locally advanced prostate cancer but should be investigated according to the standardized care pathway for urinary tract cancer

    ## PSA Testing of Asymptomatic Men

    Asymptomatic men who wish to have a prostate check should be offered the 1177 brochure on the pros and cons of PSA testing. Men with more than 10–15 years
    of expected remaining life who then wish to be tested should be offered regular PSA tests, with prostate palpation. Other men should be advised
    against PSA testing (the average remaining life expectancy for 75-year-old men is 12 years). Test intervals for men outside the hereditary risk group:

    - PSA <1 μg/l for men under about 65 years: 6 years.
    - PSA <1 μg/l for men over about 65 years: No further testing.
    - PSA 1–2.9 μg/l: Every 2 years up to about 75 years of age, thereafter no testing.
    - If the increase is >1 μg/l since the previous test, a new test should be taken after 1 year.
    - Individuals with a prostate gland and low p-testosterone (<8 nmol/l) should be tested every 2 years (men without known hypogonadism can be assumed
      to have a normal testosterone value).

    ## Referral to Standardized Care Pathway (SVF)

    If any of the following criteria are met, there is a well-founded suspicion of prostate cancer. 
    - Palpation finding suspicious of malignancy (hardening in the prostate gland), and/or
    - PSA above the threshold (men in the hereditary risk group should be referred at PSA ≥ 2 μg/l; men taking 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors at PSA above half of the
      values indicated below):
      - Men < 70 years: PSA ≥ 3 μg/l
      - Men 70–80 years: PSA ≥ 5 μg/l
      - Men > 80 years: PSA ≥ 7 μg/l

    If there is a well-founded suspicion of prostate cancer a model should be used to calculate the risk of the patient having prostate cancer. If the risk is over 5%
    the patient should take a STHLM3 blood test to further specify the risk of the patient having prostate cancer. If the risk is over 13% the patient should undergo a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)
    of the prostate. If the MRI reveals pathological findings, prostate biopsies should be conducted to further investigate the suspected malignancy. If any malignancy is found in the biopsies
    a refferal to a urological clinic for further treatment is indicated.

    The referral should include:

    - Medical history, especially
      - Symptoms or findings that form the basis for a well-founded suspicion
      - Whether the patient has previously been investigated for prostate cancer
      - The results from the prostate MRI, detailing any pathological findings or other relevant observations
      - The results from the prostate biopsies, including histopathological findings and any other pertinent data
      - General condition, functional impairments, and comorbidity, and whether any of these conditions may require an individualized
        investigation
      - Whether the patient recently had a urinary tract infection
      - Medication (especially finasteride/dutasteride, platelet inhibitors, and anticoagulants)
      - Social situation, potential language barriers
    - Contact details for the patient, including telephone number
    - Details for direct contact with the referring (direct number).

    The person referring for the investigation should inform the patient that there is reason to conduct examinations to find out whether he has
    cancer or not, what a standardized care pathway involves, what happens in the initial phase, that the patient may be called for
    investigation quickly and should therefore be available by phone, and that healthcare often calls from a hidden number.

    ## Hereditary Risk Group

    Definition: Men with a father or brother with prostate cancer and at least one first-degree relative to these also diagnosed with
    prostate cancer. Someone in the family should have been diagnosed before the age of 75.

    Men in the hereditary risk group are advised to have prostate checks from the age of 40. They should receive the brochure on PSA tests issued by 1177
    and the Regional Cancer Centers in collaboration. The first check should include a PSA test and palpation. Thereafter, depending on the PSA value:

    - PSA < 1 μg/l: PSA test every other year in primary care
    - PSA 1–1.9 μg/l: Annual PSA test in primary care
    - PSA ≥ 2 μg/l: Referral to a urologist

    Controls should be terminated when a curative treatment of prostate cancer would no longer be relevant, i.e., when the expected
    remaining lifetime is less than 10 years.

    ## Treatment with 5-Alpha-Reductase Inhibitors Affects PSA

    Finasteride and dutasteride reduce the PSA value by half within a year in patients who have benign prostatic hyperplasia without concurrent cancer.
    The patient should therefore be referred to a urologist

    - If the PSA value does not halve within a year
    - If the PSA value rises more than 0.5 μg/l above the lowest value during ongoing treatment with 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors, the man should be referred to a
      urologist

    If documentation of previous PSA values is missing, the age-dependent action limits for PSA (3/5/7 μg/l) should be halved, i.e., a referral should
    be made according to SVF for values above 1.5/2.5/3.5 μg/l.

    ## Sources of Error in Assessing PSA Values

    There are a number of error sources to be aware of when assessing PSA values. Rectal palpation does not have any clinically relevant
    impact on the PSA value.

    - Intra-individual variation: The PSA value can vary +/- 15%.
    - Measurement method: The variation between different laboratories in Sweden is around 5%.
    - Sample handling: The blood sample should be quickly centrifuged and cooled. Centrifuged serum samples are stable for 4 hours at room temperature and 24
      hours in the refrigerator, centrifuged plasma samples are stable for 8 hours at room temperature and 3 days in the refrigerator. If the sample will not be analyzed within
      these times, it should be frozen.
    - Febrile urinary tract infection often significantly increases the PSA value. It can take a year before the value normalizes. A PSA test should therefore not be taken in
      connection with a febrile urinary tract infection, unless there is a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer. If a test is still taken and
      the palpation finding is benign, PSA should be followed up one month after the end of antibiotic treatment. If the value is then significantly lower, it can be followed
      every other month until it either normalizes or plateaus above the action limit (= referral to a urologist).
    - Acute urinary retention: Acute urinary retention moderately increases the PSA value (often doubling, rarely > 20 μg/l). With a benign palpation finding, a
      PSA test should be taken at the earliest after a week.
    - Hypogonadism: It is more common for men with hypogonadism (p-testosterone < 8 nmol/l) to have advanced prostate cancer despite a low PSA value,
      than men with normal p-testosterone.
